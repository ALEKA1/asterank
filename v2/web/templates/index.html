        Asterank is a scientific and economic database of over 600,000 asteroids.
        <br>
        <br>
        We've collected, computed, or inferred important data such as asteroid
        mass and composition from multiple scientific sources. With this information,
        we estimate the costs and rewards of mining asteroids.
        <br>
        <br>
        Details on orbits and basic physical parameters are mostly sourced from
        JPL data. Composition data is less well known, so we compute generalizations
        based on spectral classification and size. Our calculations incorporate
        conclusions from multiple scientific publications in addition to cross-referencing
        known meteorite data.
