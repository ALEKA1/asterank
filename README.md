Asterank (www.asterank.com) is a thought experiment that seeks to educate and inpsire people on the viability of commercially exploiting objects in our solar system's asteroid belt.  Using publicly available data and a handful of scientific papers, it is a best guess at evaluating the economic prospects of mining some 580,000 cataloged asteroids.

Asterank has been featured on Universe Today, PhysOrg, The Daily Mail, and other sites.
