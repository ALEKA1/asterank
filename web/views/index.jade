      p With all the recent hype around asteroid mining, I wanted real numbers.  How realistic were the trillion dollar estimates?  What about the costs and overhead?

      p I've attempted to calculate or infer things like asteroid mass and composition.  Iâ€™ve collected data on their orbits and included data from NASA and JPL.  Using this information, I estimate the costs and rewards of commercially exploiting rocks in space.

      p Take a look at the results:
        ul
          li Best overall (most cost-effective)
          li Most accessible
          li Most profitable

      p There is $$ worth of rock out there.
